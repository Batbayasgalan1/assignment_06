### Summary of article (200 words):
 

It says social media is fundamentally changes teenagers' life comparing to decades ago. Even though, it seems like not long time ago. As technology improves fast as social media improves to. In recent years teenagers' daily life in social media is getting one of the crucial things ever than before. They average spend in social media is three and more hours in per day. However, the U.S. found that those who spent more than three hours a day using social media might be at heightened risk for mental health problems and predicted poor mental health and well-being in teens. As a result of excessive use social media might be cause of distraction, disrupting sleep, and exposing them to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of other people's lives and peer pressure. Speaking of exposing to unknown people, because of teens’ impulsive natures, researchers suggest that teens who post content on social media is at risk of sharing intimate photos or highly personal stories. This can result in teens being bullied, harassed or even blackmailed. They often create posts without considering these consequences or privacy concerns. As a parents, it is getting concerning idea that they have to responsible for their kids doing and care about the what they do in social media. Otherwise, it could lead bad mental results of as an earlier mentioned.
